# Callbacks
Today we will be focusing on functions and how to use callbacks with them. Functions are our way to perform actions in our code, and understaing them is essential to successfully creating software with it. 

## Lecture Topics
1. Review on primitive types, data structures and functions
2. Functions and parameters
3. Callbacks
4. High order functions


## Important to remember:

  

- Every question is welcomed. Remember that your question might not be only yours. By asking your question, you help the group

- To interact, you can either type on the chat or open your mic and talk

- Do not compare your learning process with others. Rather, observe how today you know more than you knew yesterday and create your own baseline
